# Layout of Module Projects:

### Repository 1: CMPG 323 Overview - 38239205

This repository is created for project 1:
A GitHub Kanban project that provides an overview of the various functional and non-functional requirements associated with completing each relevant project.

### Repository 2: CMPG 323 Project 2 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 2:
A CRUD RESTful API project that is connected to a provided EcoPower Logistics data source. The aim here is to provide streamlined web services that interact with the data source in order to optimize data transfer over HTTP.

### Repository 3: CMPG 323 Project 3 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 3:
A provided ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need to be updated and enhanced. The aim here is to use a developer's understanding of existing code and architectural patterns (coding principles and design patterns) to improve the project.

### Repository 4: CMPG 323 Project 4 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 4:
Further improvement on the web application from Project 3. Here the aim is to incorporate user acceptance testing (UAT) into the project's development life cycle as the crucial determining factor for either proceeding or halting before project deployment. This is done using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technologies, such as UiPath.

### Repository 5: CMPG 323 Project 5 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 5:
Final project that looks to conclude the system development cycle by providing reports about EcoPower Logistics' operational data. Reporting is done through data visualization technologies, such as Power Bi, that uses a given data source.

# Branching strategy used within module projects:

All module projects will make use of the feature branching strategy. This is a workflow strategy in which new branches are created off of the main branch, and are typically used for specific features or changes in the codebase. Once this "side" branch is completed, it can then be merged back into the main branch via a pull request. This pull request can also be reviewed for any extra modifications or improvements before being merged back into the main branch.

# Purpose of .gitignore file within each module project:

Each module project will make use of a .gitignore file in order to enusre that certain files (creation of temporarily files, compilation of binaries or storage of sensitive information) not tracked by Git remain untracked and do not get committed to the project repository.

# Storage of credentials and sensitive information:

Throughout the system development life cycle, it is imperative that each project recognises the need for the safeguarding of and storage of credentials and other sensitive information. In keeping with best practices, each project looks to capitalize on existing GitHub security features (GitHub secrets, encryption and .gitignore files) in catering towards system integrity and security.
