# Layout of Module Projects:

### Repository 1: CMPG 323 Overview - 38239205

This repository is created for project 1:
A GitHub Kanban project that provides an overview of the various functional and non-functional requirements associated with completing each relevant project.

### Repository 2: CMPG 323 Project 2 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 2:
A CRUD RESTful API project that is connected to a provided EcoPower Logistics data source. The aim here is to provide streamlined web services that interact with the data source in order to optimize data transfer over HTTP.

### Repository 3: CMPG 323 Project 3 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 3:
A provided ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need to be updated and enhanced. The aim here is to use a developer's understanding of existing code and architectural patterns (coding principles and design patterns) to improve the project.

### Repository 4: CMPG 323 Project 4 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 4:
Further improvement on the web application from Project 3. Here the aim is to incorporate user acceptance testing (UAT) into the project's development life cycle as the crucial determining factor for either proceeding or halting before project deployment. This is done using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technologies, such as UiPath.

### Repository 5: CMPG 323 Project 5 - 38239205

This repository is created for project 5:
Final project that looks to conclude the system development cycle by providing reports about EcoPower Logistics' operational data. Reporting is done through data visualization technologies, such as Power Bi, that uses a given data source.

# Branching Strategy Within Module Projects:

All module projects will make use of the feature branching strategy. This is a workflow strategy in which new branches are created off of the main branch, and are typically used for specific features or changes in the codebase. Once this "side" branch is completed, it can then be merged back into the main branch via a pull request. The pull request can also be reviewed for any modifications or improvements before being merged into the main branch.
